README for Aiki Framework
-------------------------

Aiki Framework is a flexible free and open source web 2.0 platform
that allows programmers to easily create and work with content
management systems. Aiki Framework saves all the controllers and
output templates in a database or any other storage system. This
makes Aiki easy to use and easy to customize.

Aiki Framework enables developers and website administrators to
control an unlimited number of sites in one place with an advanced
(yet very easy to use) permissions system.

Aiki provides access to the normal programming interfaces as well,
allowing developers to write their code in a less-framework-oriented
way than comparable offerings.

Aiki Framework is built on PHP and is pluggable to many SQL-based
database engines (MYSQL, PSQL, SQLite, etc).

We are also working on Python and Ruby on Rails versions, but they are
still in pre-alpha stage. You will be able to convert any website
built on the current PHP version to the Python or the Ruby alternative
(once they are completed) in one click!
