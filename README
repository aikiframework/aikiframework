README for Aikiframework 0.4
------------------------------------


Aiki Framework is a flexible open-source web 2.0 platform
that allows programmers to easily create and work with
content management systems. Aiki Framework saves all the
controllers and output templates in a database or any other
storage system. making it easy to use and easy to customize.

Aiki Framework also allows developers and website admins to
control an unlimited number of sites in one place with an advanced
(yet very easy to use) permissions system.

Aiki also gives access to the normal programming interfaces as well,
allowing developers to write their code in a less-framework-oriented
way than comparable offerings.

Aiki Framework is built on PHP and is pluggable to many SQL-based
database engines (MYSQL, PSQL, SQLite, etc).

we are also working on Python and Ruby on Rails versions,
but they still in pre-alpha. you will be able to convert any website
built on the current PHP version to the Python or the Ruby alternative
(once they are completed) in one click!!
