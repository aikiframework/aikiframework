.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Launch the web application @PACKAGE@. Aiki Framework is a flexible
.br
free and open source web 2.0 platform that allows programmers to
.br
easily create and work with content management systems. Aiki
.br
Framework saves all the controllers and output templates in a
.br
database or any other storage system. This makes Aiki easy to use
.br
and easy to customize. Aiki Framework enables developers and
.br
website administrators to control an unlimited number of sites in
.br
one place with an advanced (yet very easy to use) permissions
.br
system. Aiki provides access to the normal programming interfaces
.br
as well, allowing developers to write their code in a less
.br
framework oriented way than comparable offerings. Aiki Framework
.br
is built on PHP and is pluggable to many SQL-based database engines
.br
(MYSQL, PSQL, SQLite, etc). We are also working on Python and Ruby
.br
on Rails versions, but they are still in pre-alpha stage. You will
.br
be able to convert any website built on the current PHP version to the
.br
Python or the Ruby alternative (once they are completed) in one click!
