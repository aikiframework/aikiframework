Aiki Framework + PHP Unit
=========================

This is the salvaged phpunit tester which is not directly hooked into aiki
framework.

This folder is included with aiki to encourage people to write unit tests
for their code.


WHY?
====

Writing unit tests are a great way for programmers to test their code when
working on all sizes of projects to insure that it is working well, is
encapsulated, and stays solid through other peoples changes over time.


Installing PHPUNIT
==================

* get it from the php pear program to install the latest stable phpunit

OR

* clone the repo from https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit


Writing Unit Test
=================

To write a unit test, see libs/LogTest.php for a quick example of testing
code in Aiki Framework.

Then you can run phpunit like so:

 phpunit LogTest

If there are errors, then fix them!
